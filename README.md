RS485 Bot V1
============

This is my first python project at all. I publish it for everybody to view it and I'd love to get some feedback.

The project itself is actually an IRC bot framework, which does load plugins in the specific folder. I do consider the framework **not safe**, **nor thread-safe**, **nor ready-to-use**.

I call it *V1*, because it implies that I am working on a newer version and that is what I do. When it's source is uploaded, that will be linked from here.
